If you use Protocol Buffers in Java, you've used the API exposed by the generated Java classes that represent your data model.

And chances are good that you've wanted to add additional behavior to those classes, like simple synthetic properties based on the fields defined in your .proto file, like User#isAwesome().

Putting this code in a helper class, with static methods or delegating to an instance of the proto, is a reasonable solution, but it can get annoying. This library attempts to find your helper code and inline it into the generated code produced by protoc.
